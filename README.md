# Catalyst – Your AI Coding Mentor

Catalyst is a **Visual Studio Code extension** that aims to bridge the gap between AI-assisted coding and genuine understanding. With the rise of AI-generated code snippets, developers often copy-paste solutions without fully grasping how they work.

**Catalyst** makes that learning process engaging by:

- **Detecting pasted vs. handwritten code**
- **Reacting with a dynamic, expressive mascot**
- **Explaining the pasted code using an AI model**
- **Quizzing the user to reinforce understanding**

## Mission

We believe that AI should **support** learning — not replace it. Catalyst helps ensure developers truly understand what they’re writing by:

- Detecting copy/pasted code patterns vs. handwritten input
- Providing clear explanations for pasted code
- Generating personalized quizzes to test your comprehension
- Adapting to your learning style and providing study plans

All while being accompanied by a helpful and expressive mascot!
